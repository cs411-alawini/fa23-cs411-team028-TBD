## Project Summary

We propose Attend to Prevent, a web application dedicated to visualizing, analyzing, and interacting with COVID-19 spreading data in US. This application provides real-time maps based on the AWS COVID-19 data lake, data uploaded by users, and further the COVID-19 infection database provided by the hospital (if accessible) to help users assess the infection risk according to their current circumstances or trip plan.
As an addition, our application may also help the government and researchers to further track, analyze and predict the spread trend of COVID-19.
